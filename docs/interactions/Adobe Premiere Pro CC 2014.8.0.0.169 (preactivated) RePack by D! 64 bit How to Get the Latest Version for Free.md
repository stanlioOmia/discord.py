## Step 4: Learn some tips and tricks for Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2014
 
Now that you have installed Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2014.8.0.0.169 (preactivated) RePack by D! 64 bit, you may want to learn some tips and tricks to improve your editing skills and workflow. Here are some of the best ones we found:
 
- **Motion Blur & the Transform Effect**: If you want to add some realistic motion blur to your animated text or graphics, you can use the Transform effect under Distort effects. By unchecking Use Composition Shutter Angle and setting your own value manually, you can control the amount and direction of motion blur based on the movement of your elements[^1^].
- **Bezier Keyframes**: To make your animations smoother and more natural, you can use Bezier keyframes instead of linear ones. Bezier keyframes create a gradual ease-in and ease-out effect on any movement, which mimics how objects behave in real life. To apply Bezier keyframes, select your two keyframes, right-click and go to Temporal Interpolation, and then down to Bezier[^1^].
- **Speed Graphs**: If you want to have more control over the speed and motion of your keyframes, you can use speed graphs instead of value graphs. Speed graphs let you adjust and customize the speed and motion of your keyframes in a non-linear way, which can create more dynamic and interesting effects. To access speed graphs, click on the graph icon next to the stopwatch icon in the Effect Controls panel[^1^].
- **Track Mattes**: If you want to create some cool compositing effects, such as text behind objects or video inside shapes, you can use track mattes. Track mattes let you use one layer as a mask for another layer, which can create some amazing results. To use track mattes, place your mask layer above your source layer on a different track, then go to the source layer's Effect Controls panel and change the Track Matte Key option to match the track number of your mask layer[^2^].
- **Automate to Sequence**: If you want to quickly create a sequence from a bunch of clips in your project panel, you can use the Automate to Sequence function. This function lets you automatically place your clips on the timeline according to a preset order and transition style. To use Automate to Sequence, select your clips in the project panel, then go to Clip > Automate to Sequence and choose your settings[^3^].
