What is a DLL file and why is it important?
 
A DLL file, or dynamic link library, is a type of file that contains code and data that can be used by multiple programs at the same time. DLL files allow programs to share functionality and resources, which reduces the size and memory usage of the programs. DLL files also enable programs to be updated or modified without affecting other programs that use them.
 
However, DLL files can also cause problems when they are corrupted, missing, or incompatible with the programs that use them. This can result in error messages, crashes, or malfunctions of the programs. Therefore, it is important to keep your DLL files in good condition and fix any errors that may occur.
