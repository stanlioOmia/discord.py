The Demon Cycle series by Peter V. Brett is one of the most original and innovative fantasy series in recent years. It combines elements of horror, adventure, and mythology to create a unique and captivating story that will appeal to fans of George R.R. Martin, Brandon Sanderson, and Patrick Rothfuss. The series is set in a world where humans live in fear of the corelings, demons that rise from the earth every night and prey on anyone who ventures outside the protection of magical wards. The only hope for humanity lies in the Deliverers, prophesied heroes who can wield the power of the core and lead the people to victory.
 
The Skull Throne is the fourth book in the series and it continues the story of the two Deliverers, Ahmann Jardir and Arlen Bales, who were once friends but now enemies. Jardir is the leader of the Krasians, a desert people who follow a strict code of honor and worship a god called Everam. He believes that he is the true Deliverer and that he must unite all people under his rule and lead them to the final battle against the demons. Arlen is a former farm boy who became the Warded Man, a legendary figure who can fight the demons with his own body covered in wards. He believes that he is also a Deliverer and that he must teach everyone how to fight for themselves and resist Jardir's tyranny.
 
The Skull Throne follows the aftermath of their confrontation in The Daylight War, where they fought each other to a standstill and both suffered grave injuries. Their absence creates a power vacuum that threatens to destabilize the world and unleash chaos and war. Their followers, allies, enemies, and loved ones must deal with the uncertainty and danger that looms over them. They must also face new threats and challenges, such as a mysterious assassin who targets Jardir's family, a rogue prince who plots to overthrow his father, a cunning spy who infiltrates Arlen's camp, a powerful demon prince who seeks revenge, and a hidden cult that worships the corelings.
