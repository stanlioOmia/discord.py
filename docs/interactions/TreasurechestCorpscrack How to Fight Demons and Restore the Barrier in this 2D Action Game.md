Treasure Chest Corps is set in a world where monsters have been waging war with humans for a long time. You play as Limly, a scholar who is hired to restore the barrier tower that protects the Lam castle from the demon invasion. Along with three other adventurers, you will have to complete missions and fight your way through various enemies and bosses.
 
One of the features of Treasure Chest Corps is the random equipment system, which allows you to create a unique character with different stats and abilities. You can find and equip various items such as weapons, armor, accessories, and consumables. Each item has its own rarity and quality, which affect its performance and appearance. You can also upgrade your items with materials that you collect from enemies or chests.
 
Treasure Chest Corps has a simple but engaging gameplay that requires you to use your skills and strategy to defeat the demons. You can choose from three weapons: sword, bow, or staff. Each weapon has its own advantages and disadvantages, as well as special skills that you can activate with the right mouse button. You can also switch between your teammates at any time and control them individually or as a group.
